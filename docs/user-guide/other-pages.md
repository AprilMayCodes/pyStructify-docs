## Help

### Documentation

This page displays the User Guide information from the docs, and links to the official docs if you need additional clarification.

### Report Issue

This page has a button that will open your web browser to the "pyStructify Bug Report" form. You can use this form (or email me directly) to notify me of any bugs you find. I am not a professional developer, and this was my first project so I'm sure there's bound to be things I overlooked. Please don't hesitate to reach out if/when you find bugs. 

## Info

### About

The About page is similar to in the docs. It lists provides information like what the project is, why I made it, and who I am.

### License

Want to make sure you're app is up to date? Click the `Check For Updates` button on this page, and pyStructify will let you know if there's been an update. If there has, you can click the `Update` button to get access to the download link.

### Show Support

This page covers how you can show your support. I am a solo hobbyist developer with a full time job. As much as I'd like to transition to a software develop career, I think it won't be in the cards for quite some time. In the meantime, donations are always appreciated, but so is feedback. You can email me at contact@aprilmaycodes.com if you have any questions, concerns, or just constructive criticism.
