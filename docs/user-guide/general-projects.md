# General Projects

The General Project screen consists of 2-4 tabs, depending on what settings you chose in the New Project screen.

## Structure

### Adding Files and Folders

On the first tab, you'll create your project structure. This can be as simple or a complex as you need. To get started, simply click on the root folder.

A window will pop up where you'll have the option to add a File or a Dir (Directory). Select whichever is appropriate. The window will close and an input will appear below the directory. Type the name of the subdirectory or file (don't forget the extension) and press Enter or click `Save`.

Continue in this manner until all the folders and files you need are created.

*Note: If you click on a File, you won't have the option to add a Dir or File. That is only available for Directories.

### Editing Files and Folders

If you need to rename or delete a folder, other than the main project folder, start by clicking the item you need to edit. Above the add options are a `Rename` and a `Delete` button.

- To rename an item click the button, enter the new name, and press enter.
- To delete an item, click the delete button, and then the confirmation button.

*Note: Deleting a directory will delete **everything** within that directory*

When you are happy with your project structure, move on to the second tab.

## Packages

On the left is a list of commonly used packages. If you need anything that's not listed, simply type it into the box on the right.
Enter a new line between each item.

## Environment Variables

*Note: A SECRET_KEY is automatically included, you do not need to add that here.*
If you would like to add any additional environment variables, you can do that here. It should look like:

`VARIABLE="value"`

For example:

`MAIL_USERNAME="contact@aprilmaycodes.com"`

## Review

You have the opportunity to review your project on the final tab, before it is created.

On the right is your project structure. On the left, you can look over the settings you've chosen.

Once you're happy with your project, click `Create Project` and let the magic happen! A loading icon will pop up and then you'll be redirected to the home page once the project is complete.
